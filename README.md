# Automating Audio File Processing Through BirdNET

This project seeks to process multiple audio files through the BirdNET artificial neural network to identify birds through sound.

A python version between 3.9 but older than 3.12 is required to run the notebooks.

The notebooks are dependent on the BirdNET package which can be installed with the command 

'
