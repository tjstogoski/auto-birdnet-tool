This project seeks to process multiple audio files through the BirdNET artificial neural network to identify birds through sound.

A python version between 3.9 but older than 3.12 is required to run the notebooks.

The notebooks are dependent on the BirdNET package which can be installed with the command:  ```pip install birdnet```

Required audio files are too large to be pushed to GitHub. Audio files CP1-007_20240701_193800.wav and CP1-007_20240702_053702.wav should be saved to the folder \bird-automation\data\raw\audio_data\ before running.
